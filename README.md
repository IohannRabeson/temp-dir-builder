# temp-dir-builder

Oftentimes, testing scenarios involve interactions with the file system. `temp-dir-builder` provides a convenient solution for creating file system trees tailored to the needs of your tests. This library offers:

- An easy way to generate a tree with recursive paths.
- Tree creation within a temporary folder.
- The ability to create a tree using a builder.

## Usage

With the builder API, you can define file paths and contents in a structured way. Hereâ€™s how to create a tree with the builder:
When the `tree_fs` instance is dropped, the temporary folder and its contents are automatically deleted, which is particularly useful for tests that require a clean state.

```rust
use temp_dir_builder::TempDirectoryBuilder;
let temp_dir = TempDirectoryBuilder::default()
    .add_text_file("test/foo.txt", "bar")
    .add_binary_file("test/foo2.txt", &[98u8, 97u8, 114u8])
    .add_empty_file("test/folder-a/folder-b/bar.txt")
    .add_file("test/file.rs", file!())
    .add_directory("test/dir")
    .create()
    .expect("create temp dir");
println!("created successfully in {}", temp_dir.path().display());
```
